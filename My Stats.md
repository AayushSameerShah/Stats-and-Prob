# Aayush! Here we are!

This is an amazing time when I am noting down all these stuff for you. Let me be so open here, I know this might get long as the introduction of the Noturse (Noted + Course) but *you know* I have to be such *to make my self comfortable*. Now, it is 18th Oct 2021 (I know other people are too reading this but it's fine, not much personal ðŸ˜‰) and this time is such a phase in which I am passing by for the first time in my life. I know every second is new, I am not talking about that, but this is the time when I have to prepare for the job search and prepare for the interview. I have defined the timeline, I have **12 days** left to cover all things up.

I have to reinforce the stats fundamentals, learn new stuff in SQL and if time permits I also want to start the "Naked Stats" book. It is crazyly fast but I want to have a step ahead. Okay, fine. Let's start with what is coming next in this Noturse.

### Which course?

This time I have chosen the ***"Probability and Statistics for Business and Data Science"*** from my most favourite teacher **Jose**. Before this I have completed reading and noting from *10th, 11th and 12th* stats book. And now I am taking this one.

### What to be included?

I know, stat **isn't** the subject which should be noted in the computer, but as far as I feel it better, I will be noting it in my newly tried `StackEdit` editor. Yes! First time you will see whole course in the `.md` format.

I am planning to include all the necessary stuff like? Like points, *Aha! moments*, Formulaes and more. But will limit myself to dig much more into some topics and noting them down much much more because that is waste of energy as I already have done in my notebook. Repetation is wastage of time eventually.

### How to start?

This Noturse is well seperated (as is always âœ¨) in the well defined sections. Just go ahead and if you are reading on GitHub, then the *.md* files will be auto rendered for you. Otherwise you may have to find another solution.

That's it my boy! You are great to go ahead, let's meet you in the next section.<br>**Aayush** âˆž **Shah**
