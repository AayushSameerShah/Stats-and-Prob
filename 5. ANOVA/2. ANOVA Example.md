# ANOVA Examples
<u>Example 1</u>

- A company wants to receive faster payments
- They implement 3 strategies
	1. Give 10% discount
	2. Give 5% discount
	3. Give NO discount
- The company tracks the days from purchase to receive payment for 5 days

**Now, the question**:
Does giving discount result in faster payments?

Aha cool! Here, we can spot that we already have 3 distributions. So the problem is of ANOVA. We can't simply go with the `t` or `z` solution.

So, let's follow the procedure.
But while dealing with ANOVA, we ***we don't create the alternative assumptions*** and select the left / right type of distribution. Here, we just create the null hypothesis and build on top of it.

So the steps would slightly change. 

<u>Step 1</u>: **Set the hypothesis**
> Our CLAIM = "The offer results in faster payments"

*As said, in ANOVA the hypothesis will always be in "=" form.*

$\text{Null Hypothesis} = \text{The offer does not result in faster payments}$
$H_0 : \bar X_1 =  \bar X_2 = \bar X_3$
*Which mean all samples are from same population / nothing change.*

$\text{Alternative Hypothesis} = \text{At least one of the samples is not from the same population}$

<u>Step 2</u>: **Set level of significance**
Here, we will define our old bro $\alpha = 0.05$.

*Since, we don't need to look for the tail type — left or right, we won't decide the tail type.*

— Now, the ANOVA calculations — 
*(The steps in bold - not in underline)*

**Step 3**: **Calculate mean of each sample**
$\text{With 10\% discount} = \#_1,~\#_2,~\#_3,~\#_4,~\#_5$
$\text{With 5\% discount}~~ = \#_1,~\#_2,~\#_3,~\#_4,~\#_5$
$\text{With No discount} ~~~= \#_1,~\#_2,~\#_3,~\#_4,~\#_5$

Means are:

$\text{mean}(\text{With 10\% discount}) = \bar x_1 = 12$
$\text{mean}(\text{With 5\% discount})~~ = \bar x_2 = 17$
$\text{mean}(\text{With No discount}) ~~~= \bar x_3 = 16$

**Step 4**: **Calculate mean of means**

$\bar x_\text{total} =\frac{12 + 17 + 16}{3} = 15$

**Step 5**: **Calculate SSG**

$SSG = [(15 - 12)^2 + (15 - 17)^2 + (15 - 16)^2] \times n_\text{rows}$
$~~~~~~~~~=14 \times 5$
$~~~~~~~~~=70$
$\therefore SSG = 70$

**Step 6**: **Calculate Degree of Freedom for Groups ( $df_\text{group}$ )**
$df_{\text{group}} = n_\text{groups} - 1$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~ = 3 - 1$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~= 2$
$\therefore df_{\text{group}} = 2$

**Step 7**: **Calculate SSI**
$SSI = \sum(\bar x_g - x_{gi})^2$
$~~~~~~~~ = \sum(\bar x_1 - x_{1i})^2 + \sum(\bar x_2 - x_{2i})^2 + \sum(\bar x_3 - x_{3i})^2$
$~~~~~~~~= 34 + 106 + 58$
$~~~~~~~~= 198$
$\therefore SSI= 198$

**Step 8**: **Calculate the Degrees of Freedom for Internals ($~df_\text{internals}~$)**
$df_{\text{internal}} = (n_\text{rows} - 1) \times n_\text{groups}$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ = (5 - 1) \times  3$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= 12$
$\therefore df_{\text{internals}} = 12$

**Step 9**: **Get the F score**

$SSG = 70$
$SSI = 198$
$df_{\text{group}} = 2$
$df_{\text{internals}} = 12$

$F = \frac{\frac{SSG} {df_{\text{group}}}} {\frac{SSI}{df_{\text{internal}}}}$

$~~~~=\frac{ \frac{70}{2} }{ \frac{198}{12} }$

$~~~~= 2.121$

$\therefore F = 2.121$

**Step 10**: **Get the critical score**
Looking at the table, we get $3.885$ as the critical value for `0.05` confidence and 2 and 12 are the numerator and denominator respectively.

### Now compare the F scores

Since the `F` value falls to the left of critical value:
$2.121 < 3.885 = \text{TRUE}$

Hence, we will ***FAIL TO REJECT*** the null hypothesis which is $H_0 : \bar X_1 =  \bar X_2 = \bar X_3$ and say that:
> We don't have enough to support the idea that our offers have changed the average number of days that customers too to pay their invoices.

**Cool!**

We will lean towards 2 Way ANOVA. *(The thing we just saw above was 1 Way.)*
