# How 2 Way Works
This time I am gonna make a table and then with which will workout the solution. Let's go without much talk.

The problem is the same: ***"Does the discount and price make difference in days to receive faster payments?"*** 

Of course you may have noted that the question is **changed** a little bit as the second variable the ***price*** is introduced.


|      | 10% Discount  | 5% Discount  | No Discount  | Means   |
|--    |--             |--            |--            |--       |
| $50  | #  | #  | #  | **20**  |
| $100 | #  | #  | #  | **17**  |
| $150 | #  | #  | #  | **15**  |
| $200 | #  | #  | #  | **13**  |
| $250 | #  | #  | #  | **10**  |
| Means| **12**  | **17**  | **16**  | **`15`** |

<U>Step 1</U>: **Set the hypothesis**
$\text{Null Hypothesis = The price and discount doesn't make any difference}$
$\therefore H_0: \bar X_1 =  \bar X_2 =  \bar X_3$

$\text{Alternative Hypothesis = At least one sample mean differs from all other sample means}$
*The alternative hypothesis says that: we have some significant difference*

<U>Step 2</u>: 	**Set the level of significance**
Here, we will define our old bro $\alpha = 0.05$.
*Since, we don't need to look for the tail type — left or right, we won't decide the tail type.*

*(The steps in bold - not in underline)*

 
**Step 3**: **Calculate mean of each sample**
- Group Means are:
	- $\bar x_\text{10D} = 12$
	- $\bar x_\text{5D} = 17$
	- $\bar x_\text{NoD} = 16$
- Block Means are:
	- $\bar x_\text{50Dlr} = 20$
	- $\bar x_\text{100Dlr} = 17$
	- $\bar x_\text{150Dlr} = 15$
	- $\bar x_\text{200Dlr} = 13$
	- $\bar x_\text{250Dlr} = 10$

**Step 4**: **Calculate mean of means**
$\bar x_\text{total} =\frac{12 + 17 + 16}{3} = 15$

**Step 5**: **Calculate SSG**
$SSG = [(15 - 12)^2 + (15 - 17)^2 + (15 - 16)^2] \times n_\text{rows}$
$~~~~~~~~~=14  \times  5$
$~~~~~~~~~=70$
$\therefore SSG = 70$

**Step 6**: **Calculate SSB**
$SSB = [(15 - 20)^2 + (15 - 17)^2 + (15 - 15)^2 + (15 - 13)^2 + (15 - 10)^2] \times n_\text{columns}$
$~~~~~~~~~=58  \times  3$
$~~~~~~~~~=174$
$\therefore SSB = 174$

**Step 7**: **Calculate Degree of Freedom for Groups ( $df_\text{group}$ )**
$df_{\text{group}} = n_\text{groups} - 1$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~ = 3 - 1$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~= 2$
$\therefore df_{\text{group}} = 2$

**Step 8**: **Calculate Degree of Freedom for Internals ( $df_\text{internals}$ )**
$df_{\text{internals}} = (n_\text{rows} - 1) (n_\text{columns} - 1)$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~ = (5 - 1) (3 - 1)$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~= 8$
$\therefore df_{\text{internals}} = 8$

**Step 9**: **Calculate Total Variance**
SST = Subtract the total mean $\bar x_\text{total}$ from all elements, square up and addup.
$\therefore SST = 268$


**Step 10**: **Calculate SSI**
$SSI = SST - SSG - SSB$
$~~~~~~~~=268 - 70 - 174$
$~~~~~~~~=24$
$\therefore SSI = 24$

**Step 11**: **Calculate F score**
$F = \frac{\frac{SSG}{df_\text{groups}}}{\frac{SSI}{df_\text{internals}}}$

$~~~~ = \frac{\frac{70}{2}}{\frac{24}{8}}$

$F = 11.67$

Now, it is the time to compare the F.
So, we have:
- Degree of freedom on the numerator  (df$_\text{groups}$) = 2
- Degree of freedom on the denominator (df$_\text{groups}$) = 8

Thus, looking at the f table, with the $\alpha = 0.05$, we get our critical value `4.46`

**Compare**:
$\text{Calculated F} < \text{Critical Value}$
$11.67 < 4.46$
$\text{FALSE}$

Hence, we will **REJECT** the null hypothesis of all means are same. And we will take the alternative hypothesis to the consideration. 

Thus, it **MAKES DIFFERENCE**. 

# Great!
We are getting amazing! Now, see the example just here we saw was of **2 Way Without Replication**. Next up, we will learn about the **With Replication**. 

See you there ∞
