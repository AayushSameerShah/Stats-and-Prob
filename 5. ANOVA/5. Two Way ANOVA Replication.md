# With Replication
Sounds new, isn't it? This time, we will have multiple observations for blocks. Let's see the difference.

Previously, in the **without replication format** we had the table like ↓

|     |Group1 |Group2 |
|--   |--    |--   |
|Block1| #    | #   |
|Block2| #    | #   |
|Block3| ...  | ... |

Now, in the **with replication format** we have the table like ↓

|     |Group1 |Group2 |
|--   |--    |--   |
|Block1| #    | #   |
|      | #    | #   |
|      | #    | #   |
|Block2| #    | #   |
|      | #    | #   |
|      | #    | #   |
|Block3| ...    | ...   |
|      | ...    | ...   |

It is, the ***multiple entries / observations per block***. So, we can *also* have the mean per each block, right?

Bro, I don't think need to go much in detail, as you are here after reading the preceding materials, so here, I will demonstrate the steps directly and solving the example as well.

With the **data structure** in mind, we are ***great*** to go.
___
- We are measuring the *Rose*, *Neem* and *Tulsi* plants (Variable 1 = Plant Type)
- They are measured under 2 conditions *Warm* and *Cold* (Variable 2 = Environmental Condition)
- Then we grow the plants under such conditions and then measure the heights.
- We take 3 observation per condition.

The tale looks like this ↓

|           |Rose  |Neem   |Tulsi   |
|---        |---   |---    |---     |
|**Cold**   |13    |21     |18      |
|           |14    |19     |15      |
|           |12    |17     |15      |
|**Warm**   |16    |14     |15      |
|           |18    |11     |13      |
|           |17    |14     |8       |

**Firstly**, we will summarize the table.
Taking mean by each block on each group.

|          | Rose | Neem | Tulsi |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| **Cold** | 13   | 19   | 16    |
| **Warm** | 17   | 13   | 12    |

<br>

**Secondly**, we will get the ***group, block*** and ***total*** means:

|          | Rose | Neem | Tulsi | `Mean →` |
|----------|------|------|-------|----------|
| **Cold** | 13   | 19   | 16    | 16       |
| **Warm** | 17   | 13   | 12    | 14       |
| `Mean ↓` | 15   | 16   | 14    | **`15`** |

Yes, they are calculated on the summarized tables.

***Thirdly***, we will get the **SSG**.
It is same as we have been doing since then, here same we will get the difference between group means $\bar x_g$ and the total men $\bar x_\text{total}$.

$SSG = [(15 - 15)^2 + (15 - 16)^2 +(15 - 14)^2] \times n_\text{rows}$
$~~~~~~~~~= 2 \times 6$
$~~~~~~~~~= 12$
$\therefore SSG = 12$

<br>

***Fourthly***, we will get the **DF$_\text{groups}$**.
$df_\text{groups} = n_\text{groups} - 1$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~ = 3 - 1$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~ = 2$
$\therefore df_\text{groups} = 2$

<br>

↓ BE ALERT HERE ↓
***Fifthly***, we will get the **SSB**.
It will be the same as we did in the 2 way without replication ***but*** while multiplying, we will have to take care of. It is the squared difference between mean of blocks $\bar x_b$ and total mean $\bar x_\text{total}$.

$SSB = [(15 - 16)^2 + (15 - 14)^2] \times n_\text{elements per block}$
$~~~~~~~~~= 2 \times 9$
$~~~~~~~~~= 18$
$\therefore SSB = 18$

> Notice there ↑ instead of $n_\text{columns}$ we are using $n_\text{elements per block}$. Which is shown here ↓
![9 Per block](https://i.imgur.com/AYqf7CG.png)

Now, I hope you understood the idea behind that mysterious number!

↓ BE ALERT HERE ↓
***Sixthly***, find the **DF$_\text{internal}$**.
$df_\text{internal} = \text{Blocks} \times  \text{Groups} \times (\text{Groups} - 1)$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= 2  \times  3  \times (3 - 1)$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= 12$


$\therefore df_\text{internal} = 12$
*(I am not sure, about why the groups is taken twice. But let's proceed with this example.)*

### NEW
**Seventhly**, find the Sum of Squares Intersections! ($SS_{Int}$)
*Now, actually this $SS_{Int}$ is called SSI, but as we have already reserved SSI for ourselves instead of using SSE all time, we will keep calling SSE as SSI and this here SSI will be called $SS_{Int}$ (Read Again if you didn't get it but it is no much important).*

> In here, we will **subtract** group mean ($\bar x_g$), block mean ($\bar x_b$) from **all elements in the summarized table** and then will add the total mean ($\bar x_\text{total}$ to it.) 

So the formulae (new one)

$$ SS_{Int} = \sum( x_i - \bar x_g - \bar x_b + \bar x_\text{total}) \times n_\text{obs\\/block}$$

Here, we will go like ↓

|          | Rose | Neem | Tulsi | `Mean →` |
|----------|------|------|-------|----------|
| **Cold** | 13   | 19   | 16    | 16       |
| **Warm** | 17   | 13   | 12    | 14       |
| `Mean ↓` | 15   | 16   | 14    | **`15`** |
*The summarized table*

$SS_{Int} = \\
\\  \\
(13 - 15 - 16 + 15)^2 + \\ 
(19 - 16 - 16 + 15)^2 + \\ 
(16 - 14 - 16 + 15)^2 + \\
(17 - 15 - 14 + 15)^2 + \\
(13 - 16 - 14 + 15)^2 + \\
(12 - 14 - 14 + 15)^2 = 28 \times 3$ 

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=84$
$\therefore SS_{Int} = 84$

*(Note that, "3" is the observations per block)*

**Eightly**, Find total variance ( **SST** )
This is simply done by subtracting and squaring each element from the totla mean.
$\therefore SST = 164$
Again, here no need to multiply any number here.

**Ninely**, Find Internal variance ( **SSI** )
Here, our SST is:
$SST = SSG + SSB + SSI + SS_{Int}$

So, we will find the SSI in this way:
$SSI = SST - SSG - SSB - SS_{Int}$
$~~~~~~~~=164 - 12 - 18 - 84$
$~~~~~~~~=50$
$\therefore SSI = 50$

___
Now, we have all things together:
- SSG
- SSB
- SSI
- SS$_{Int}$
- df$_\text{group}$
- df$_\text{internal}$

Putting things into place

$F = \frac{\frac{SSG}{df_\text{group}}}{ \frac{SSI}{df_\text{internal}}}$

$~~~~ = \frac{\frac{12}{2}}{ \frac{50}{12}}$

$~~~~=1.44$

Getting critical value with:
- Numerator = df$_\text{group}$ = 2
- Denominator = df$_\text{internal}$ = 12
- $\alpha = 0.05$

The critical value is 3.885.

Thus, the `f value` 1.44 lies to the left of our critical value and we will ***fail to reject*** the null hypothesis.

# That Was A Lot!
Of course this is not to remember, it is just to refer when ever you want. Great!
