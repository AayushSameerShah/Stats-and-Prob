# Chi-Square!
*It is easier than I thought! Really!*

### What & Why
**WHAT**:
- It is from Karl Pearson *(A dude who has **massive** contribution in stats, he has his hands everywhere in almost every topic in stats.)*
- This chi-square is basically answers **"The Goodness Of Fit"** of some event.
- Which means, whether the observed results ***stray too far*** away ***from the expected*** results.
- It is written as $\chi^2$.

*(It is **not** $X^2$, it is $\chi^2$ which has a special syntax in latex `\chi^2`)*
<br>
**WHY**:
It is *as said*, to check the **goodness of the event** to occur. **Like**, if I flipped a coin 15 times and if it **came** 13 heads. 

Is it due to complete chance?
or
A coin is biased?

Of course, we can't answer certainly, but we can check the $\chi^2$ to determine that let's say that "*we are 95% confident that it can happen*". There, we can also set the confidence level as we did.

In another way around:
> It is a check for the occurred event whether is it by complete chance or it can happen.

It may sound like the **Poisson** or **Binomial** distribution which we saw before, but the problem there was ***we could only check for the even which has only 2 outcomes***. Here, in chi-square we can check for such event which has 2 or more outcomes.

**Butt** *(no that butt)*, it is **NOT** same as those poisson or binomial. It is different. It is **LIKE** them, but **NOT SAME**. It shows different thing.

The official definition:
> The **chi-square** is used to determine the probability of an **observed** frequency of event **given an expected** frequency.

 
### Easy Formulae
# $$\chi^2 = \sum\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}$$
$O$ = Observed Values
$E$ = Expected Values

**NOTE**: There is '$\sum$' there, which means we will do this for all possibilities. Means, for an example — 

12 heads out of 16: 
1. First outcome
	- O = 12 heads *(Observed)*
	- E = 8 heads *(Expected 8 out of 16 as heads prob is $\frac{1}{2}$)*
2. First outcome
	- O = 4 tails *(Observed)*
	- E = 8 tails *(Expected 8 out of 16 as tails prob is $\frac{1}{2}$)*

Thus, we will —

$\chi^2 = \sum\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}$

$~~~~~=\frac{(12 - 8)^2}{8} + \frac{(4 - 8)^2}{8}$
$~~~~~=2 + 2$
$~~~~~= 4$

**Of course**, if we were be rolling a paasa, then we would have to do the same equation for 6 times means, you know $..+..+..+..+..+..$ gotcha!

## Here comes the best part

Look at the chart above ↑
I know, seems frustrating, but is is easy. Trust me ∞

**Here is**, the Degrees of Freedom element.
> Here Degrees of Freedom is **a number of total outcomes - 1**. 

Hence, for the coin flip example it is $2 - 1 = 1$ and in the paasa example $6 - 1 = 5$. So there based on the $\chi^2$ and the $df$ and the pre-determined $\alpha$, we will do:
1. Draw a line on y axis based on the confidence level $\alpha$. *(here 0.05)*
2. Where the $\chi^2$ and $\alpha$ intersect for the given $df$, get the critical value.
3. The critical value is obtained from the **chi-table** *(a new table after `z`, `t` and `f`)*

It looks like ↓

And, more precisely ↓

Remember, we are dealing with **$df$ & $\alpha$**  only, there is no contribution of the $\chi^2$ here. So the x axis is useless for now.

Now **what about the $\chi^2$ ?**
> A low $\chi^2$ value means a **high** correlation between the observed value (O) and the expected value (E) — which is of course the difference will be low (O - E) if the both are same / near. Hence it will high correlated. If the difference is high, then some suspicious going on there.

Here, we've got $\chi^2 = 4$, $df = 1$, and critical value for $df = 1$ & $\alpha = 0.05$ is `3.841`.

So now:
$\chi^2 < \text{Critical value}$ 
$4 < 3.841 = \text{FALSE}$ 

Hence, we will **reject** the null hypothesis and it means **THE COIN IS FREAKIN' BIASED**. *(with 95% confidence)*
