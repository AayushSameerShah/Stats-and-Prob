# Hype Exampe
<u>**Ex. 1** *(for mean)*</u>
- A company is looking for its website improvement
- *Current time* their site takes to load is: `3.125 seconds`
- *Standard Deviation* of loading time is: `0.7 seconds`
- They hire an IT person to improve their site performance
- ***The company wants `99%` confidence*** that the site speed has improved.

The, the person changed the shitty code, and then optimized the speed. Now, after checking after `40 Trials` the average page load time is `2.975 seconds`. 

**Now The Question**:
*Are you 99% confident that the mean time you've got of 2.975 seconds will work for everyone?*
—

Now, see - there was trial. It means the person has to try on different devices, different internet speed etc. Now, of course he has a **limit**. He can't just go to check all devices in the world and then come to boss saying "Hey our website loads faster on all device in the world". It is utter nonsense to go for a billion devices.

Instead, he will check on few (here 40) then he will use **stats** to generalize it and give some result to the boss according to the confidence required.

**Now, how to check?** 
Simple: It is the problem of our ***hypothesis testing***.
*(See, for the first time I am learning such thing that can be used to generalize from the sample to population. It is exciting.)*
___
**Solution**:

<u>Step 1</u>: **Assign the labels to the given values**
$\bar X = 3.125~~$ *(existing average load time)*
$\sigma = 0.7~~~~~~~$ *(existing standard deviation)*
$\alpha = 0.01 ~(99\% \text{ conffidence} → 0.99 → 1 - 0.99 = 0.01)$
$n = 40~~~~~~~~$ *(40 trials)*
$\bar x = 2.975~~~$ *(average load time on 40 trials)*

<u>Step 2</u>: **Set the both hypothesis**
> Our CLAIM = *"Our website is running faster"*

**SEE!** ↑ we are using the ***want to*** claim. In which we will flip the testing as we have seen in the introduction file. It is because **we don't assume that the website is running faster, but we *know* that it is running faster on 40 samples so we *want* it to be true**.

<u>NULL</U>:
$\text{Null Hype = The website is runnig slower}$
$\therefore H_0 = \bar X \ge 3.125$
*(We used ↑ $\bar X$ instead of $\bar x$ because the final / the population's load time has to be shown.)*

<u>ALTERNATIVE</U>:
$\text{Alternative Hype = The website is runnig faster}$
$\therefore H_1 = \bar X \lt 3.125$

<u>Step 3</u>: **Set level of significance**
Here, the management already gave use `99% = 0.01`, this will use it, otherwise we would have taken `0.05`.
$\therefore \alpha = 0.01$

<u>Step 4</u>: **Determine the test type**

![Type of problem](https://i.imgur.com/qgEALxi.png)
Now, in selecting the type of test, we use the **alternative hypothesis** as the base. So based on the alternative hypothesis $\bar X \lt 3.125$, we can say that the types is **LEFT TAIL / LESS THAN**. 

<u>Step 5</u>: **Calculate test statistic**
(As ***this problem is a type of MEAN***)
### $z = \frac{\bar x - \mu}{\frac{\sigma} {\sqrt{n~}}}$
$~~~~= \frac {2.975 ~-~3.125} { \frac{0.7} {\sqrt{40}} }$

$~~~~= -2.259$
Hence, our z score is `-2.259`.

### ***If we are following traditional method***
<u>Step 6</u>: **Get the critical value**
- Here, we have the $\alpha = 0.01$ which is the p value.
- We have the z score = -2.259.
- We can't actually **compare p value with z score** 
- So we will convert the alpha value to **critical value**.

Here, $\alpha = 0.01$ → $z = -2.325$
Which is `p   →   z`.

Hence, now we have the threshold value for comparison which is `-2.325` (a new z which we have got from conversion of alpha).

So, our Null Hypothesis is  $\bar X \ge 3.125$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\therefore -2.259 \ge -2.325$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\therefore \text{TRUE}$

Which means, the test statistic falls **outside of the rejection region**. So we will fail to reject the hypothesis.

### ***If we are following P-value method***
<u>Step 6</u>: **Get the P value**
Here, we **will not** calculate the critical value.
Here, instead of converting alpha to z (p → z), we will convert our calculated z to p (z → p) and then we will compare with the alpha.

Hence,
$z = -2.259$ *(from step 5)* 
Conversion of z → p
$~~~~~~~~~~-2.259$ → $0.0119$

Hence we have the p value 0.0119.
Our NULL Hypothesis: $\bar X \ge 3.125$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\therefore 0.0119 \ge 0.01$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\therefore \text{TRUE}$

Here, remember this phrase:
> If the P-value is low,
> the **null** must go! (reject)

> If the P-value is high,
> the **null** must fly! (fail to reject)

Here, we can't draw on the chart but based on the phrase said above, our ***P-value is high*** = TRUE so we will fail to reject.

**See? Both way it works.**

Thus, in just 7 steps our work is done. I can simply make a python program to do this for me. It is easy. No need to memorize. Just keep in mind that such things exist.

<u>**Ex. 2** *(for proportion)*</u>
- A videogame company surveys `400 people` who are their customers.
- They found out that `58%` of 400 are the teenagers

**The Question:**
*Is it fair to say that **most** of the company's customers are teenagers?*

**Solution**:
Now, of course this problem is of the "Proportion". Here, we are given the `58%` and `most` as the guiding terms. In addition, we are not given the stuff like mean and std. So, clearly we have the problem of proportion.

Now, thing is that — we have only surveyed the 400 customers. It is the **sample** but not the population. Now, we want to check whether the most of our customers (population) are the teenagers.

The statement just above, has the term "***most***". Now, the *most* means `More than 50%`. So... let's get them in a statistical way. 

<u>Step 1</u>: **Assign the labels to the given values**
$n = 400~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ *(400 people)*
$\text{Sample Proportion} = \hat p = 0.58~~$ *(58% of them)*

<u>Step 2</u>: **Set the both hypothesis**
> Our CLAIM = *"Most of our customers are the teenagers"*

Again, here we ***want to be true***. So ↓

<u>NULL</U>:
$\text{Null Hype = Most of the customers are not teenagers.}$
$\therefore H_0 = P \le 0.5$
*(We used ↑ $P$ instead of $\hat p$ because the final / the population's age proportion has to be shown. P = Parameter)*

<u>ALTERNATIVE</U>:
$\text{Alternative Hype = Most of the customers are teenagers.}$
$\therefore H_1 = P \gt 0.5$

<u>Step 3</u>: **Set level of significance**
Here, no confidence is given. So, we will take the default.
$\therefore \alpha = 0.05$

<u>Step 4</u>: **Determine the test type**
From the **alternative hypothesis**, which is $H_1 = P \gt 0.5$ we can say that the types is **RIGHT TAIL / GREATER THAN**. 
![Right Tail](https://i.imgur.com/1TIlbCS.png)

<u>Step 5</u>: **Calculate test statistic**
(As ***this problem is a type of PROPORTION***)
### $z = \frac{\hat p - p}{\frac{\sqrt{p ~\cdot~ q~}}{n}}$
$~~~~= \frac{0.58 - 0.5}{\frac{\sqrt{0.5 ~\cdot~ 0.5~}}{400}}$

$~~~~=3.2$
Hence, our z score is `3.2`.

***This time, following the P-value method***
<u>Step 6</u>: **Get the P value**
Here, we will convert our calculated z = 3.2 to p.
$\therefore z → p$

Hence,
$z = 3.2$ *(from step 5)* 
Conversion of z → p
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~3.2$ → $0.00068$

Hence we have the p value 0.00068.
Our NULL Hypothesis: $H_0 = P \le 0.5$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\therefore 0.00068 \le 0.05$
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\therefore \text{TRUE}$

Here, recall this phrase:
> If the P-value is low,
> the **null** must go! (reject)

> If the P-value is high,
> the **null** must fly! (fail to reject)

Our **P-value is less** = TRUE, then we will *reject* the null hypothesis ie. most of our customers are not teenagers.

So, we will fail to reject the **alternative hypothesis** which is, most of our customers are teenagers.

# Great! Great!! Great!!!
I liked it so much! Amazing stuff. I have for the first time calculated such stuff by hand. Amazing!!!

👍 One Rule of Thumb :
> When you are presented in a situation that *requires* kind of check — whether or not you should do this or not, there are high chances that the problem is of **hypothesis** testing.
