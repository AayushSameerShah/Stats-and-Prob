# Statistics
> It is the application of ***what*** we ***know*** and ***what*** we ***want to know***. 

Here, we get confidence, we pass-through the decision making process. The stuff we have calculated with the *tools* learnt before this, here we will determine the *strength* or the *confidence* of how trustable or reliable they are.

Small Points:
- **Population**
- **Sample**
- **Parameter**: A ***charecteristic of population***. Often we want to understand parameters.
- **Statistic**: A ***charecteristic of sample***. Often we apply statistical inferences to the sample in attempt <U>to describe</U> the population.
- **Variable**: A characteristic the describes a member of the sample.
	- Discrete
	- Continuous

# I know,
It was so little to make a book for stats. But from next file (book) we will try to understand the sampling techniques.
