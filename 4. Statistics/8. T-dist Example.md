# Alrighty
<font size=6><b>N</b></font>ow, we know what the t-test is, wait — just for the reminder, *it is much like the z score but it is used when we want to reject or not to reject the hypothesis when we don't have the standard deviation of the population.*

Commonly we will be presented in such situation where we have to compare **2** samples together, instead of just one itself.  Here, we are gonna take the example of the same.

**Example**:
- A company has 2 sites
- That company makes the cars
- Both sites produce the cars
- Company has low budget, so decided to shut one of the sites
- To shut the sites, it needs some statistically significant numbers to know which to shut
- Currently the company has decided to shut such site which produces lower number of cars
- The company recorded the daily production of 10 days.

*(Not caring about the numbers)*
**Site A**: $\#_1,~\#_2,~ \#_3, ...~ \#_{10}$
**Site B**: $\#_1,~\#_2,~ \#_3, ...~ \#_{10}$

Done! Now, it is on us to do something.
___
**Solution**:
Seemingly, it is the problem of **2 independent samples test**. So, here we might have to use that big formulae to find the degree of freedom if the variance of both sites are not same.

As we know the steps — the common steps of hypothesis testing:

<u>Step 1:</u> **Assign the labels to the given values**

From the data:
**Site A**: $\#_1,~\#_2,~ \#_3, ...~ \#_{10}$
**Site B**: $\#_1,~\#_2,~ \#_3, ...~ \#_{10}$

We have the means:
$\bar x_1 = 1222$
$\bar x_2 = 1186$
$n = 10$

<u>Step 2:</u> **Set the hypothesis**
Now, from the given data, we have found the `1222` for site 1 and `1186` for site 2 as the mean. 

Now, see — our investigation ***would have ended here if the difference between the production of two sites were large***. And then we would have declared one of them to shut. But here, if we try to take a look: $|\bar x_1 - \bar x_2| = 36$. 

The difference is only 36 in both of the sites car production. So, it is a signal *(not the technical - in formula wala signal)* that we should do some further investigation to get statistically significant.

> Our CLAIM: The site 1 is doing better than site 2

<u>NULL</u>:
$\text{Null Hype = The site 1 is not doing better than site 2}$
$\therefore H_0 = \bar X_1 \le \bar X_2$
*↑ Again, see we used the $\bar X_1$ and $\bar X_2$ because we want to generalize for the population*.

<u>ALTERNATIVE</u>:
$\text{Alternative Hype = The site 1 is doing better than site 2}$
$\therefore H_1 = \bar X_1 \gt \bar X_2$

<u>Step 3:</u> **Set the level of significance**
Here, nothing is given, so we will assume the default $\alpha = 0.05$. Which means we are `95%` confident about the result.

<u>Step 4:</u> **Determine the test type**
From the **alternative hype** $H_1 = \bar X_1 \gt \bar X_2$ we can say that the test shape is **greater than \ right tail**. 

<u>Step 5:</u> **Calculate the statistic**
Recall, that we have 2 sample problem here. So we should take the formulae:
### $$t=\frac{| \bar x_1 - \bar x_2 |}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

Here, $s = \text{Standard Deviation}$ ***so*** $s^2 = \text{Variance}$.

$s_1^2 = 1248$
$s_2^2 = 1246$

See, the variance are much closer *(Not to say the same)*. So we can use the short version to find the $df$ *(Degree of freedom)*. 

$t=\frac{| \bar x_1 - \bar x_2 |}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$

$~~~=\frac{| 1222 - 1186 |}{\sqrt{\frac{1248}{10} + \frac{1246}{10}}}$

$~~~=\frac{36}{15.792}$

$t = 2.28$

Hence, our t-score is `2.28`.

<u>Step 6:</u> **Get the critical value**
Here, we are taking the treditional method in which we convert the $\alpha → z$. So here as we are dealing with $t$, we will use the term $\alpha → t$.

Now, it comes the **degree of freedom**.
> See, our sample variances $s_1$ and $s_2$ are similar. *(Just 2 unit difference is ignorable)*
> <br>
> So, we will use the $df = n_1 + n_2 - 2$ formulae to get the df. Why to get the df? See the image below ↓

![t-table](https://i.imgur.com/7XIPih3.png)

See? As we are dealing with the **one-tail** problem we will take a look at that respectively. The number **18** is the degree of freedom calculated here ↓

$df = n_1 + n_2 - 2$
$~~~~~~ = 10 + 10 - 2$
$~~~~~~ = 18$

***(If we would have calculated the degree of freedom in the long / complex formulae, then it would have been similar like 17.987. But this 18 will work for now.)***

→ So the critical value `t` is = `1.734`

What we did here? We just converted our pre-defined critical value `0.05` / `95%` confidence in a form of `t`. So that we can ***compare*** the values.

So, out null hypothesis:
$H_0 = \bar X_1 \le \bar X_2$
$~~~~~~= 2.28 \le 1.734$
$~~~~~~= \text{FALSE}$

See, here it is not the *p-value* approach where we wanna use the phrase of "if p is high, it must fly...", here we can directly get to the decision either to **reject** or **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.

We can even look at the problem in the visual ↓

***NOTE:*** The image shown above ↑ is for `t distribution`.  Which usually has the fatter tails. But for the sake of copy and paste the image is used of `z distribution / normal`. But it proves the point.

Hence, we will **reject** the null hypothesis of "The site 1 is not doing better than site 2" and we ill **not reject** the alternative hype.

So,
**We can say with 95% confidence that site 1 produces more cars than site 2.**

# It is easy!
Don't remember. Refer when you required. This is made in such a way that you can refer anytime. Just thing to keep in mind while deciding **which tail** distribution it is gonna be. And then that's it.
