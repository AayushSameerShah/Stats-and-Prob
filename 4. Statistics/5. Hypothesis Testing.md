# Hypothesis Testing
> *It is the application of statistical methods to real-world questions.*

<font size=6><b>S</b></font>ee, this concept is gonna be one of the best one to learn in the statistics. Don't freak out with the word "Hypothesis", I know it sounds freaky. This time, I will try *not to skip* things and at the same time will not go much in details. 

I actually want to learn this concept so that I can start using it from the data zero. So, will learn just enough here.

**In human words**:
Hypothesis testing. What words do we have here? 
1. **Hypothesis**: It is the assumption that we are making for the data.
2. **Testing**: It is where we test the assumption whether is it right or not.

Things are ***systematic*** here. We won't just assume something and test it without a framework. We have got some methods like *what if the assumption fails, what to do next, how to test the assumption, rule of thumbs, level of significance* etc.

So let's look in the brief detail.
- We start with the **first initial assumption** called: ***NULL HYPOTHESIS***.
- Then we ***run an experiment*** to test the null hypothesis.
- Based on the results of an experiment, we either ***reject*** or ***fail to reject*** the null hypothesis.

**BAM**? Why *instead of* <u>reject or accept</u>, we use <u>reject or fail to reject</u>?

- **REJECT**: The experiment failed to support hypothesis, so we will not continue with the hypothesis.
- **FAIL TO REJECT**: The experiment *supports* the hypothesis, so we will continue with the hypothesis.

#### But still, why not ACCEPT it? Why FAIL TO REJECT it?
Mhhmm, good question. The reason is: "***We never PROVE a hypothesis***". Since a hypothesis can't be proven - we can not accept it. Thus we have to use just a different terminology. *(I would say **REJECT** and **NOT-REJECT**, why to use FAIL TO REJECT!!)*.
> When the hypothesis is **rejected**, then we say: "The data supports another, mutually exclusive hypothesis: ***Alternative Hypothesis***.

Read that again ↑ if you haven't.

There is another term or hypothesis called: *Alternative*. And also note the term *Mutually Exclusive*. That means, at minimum we can have 2 hypothesis and both are mutually exclusive. <u>So if one is true then second has to be false.</u>

### Framing the Hypothesis
This is where we learn *to convert the real world question to the hypothesis (statement)*.

*(HYPE = Hypothesis)*
___
**Form NULL HYPE**:
- At the start of an experiment, ***a null hype is assumed to be true.***
- Which means, first **we believe what we assume**, then we run an experiment and based on the results we make changes in our beliefs.
- If the experiment fails to support our initial belief aka Null Hype, then we can start looking for the **Alternative Hype**. 

**CLAIM / Assumption**: *The 	product that we ship has an average weight of 5 kg.*
<br>

And if,
**NULL Hype**: $\text{Average weight} = 5 kg$
**ALTERNATIVE Hype**: $\text{Average weight} \neq 5 kg$

**WANT / Not-Assumption**: *If a person takes udemy class, his final year test scores improves.*

Thus,
**NULL Hype**: $\text{Old Score} \ge \text{Final Score}$
**ALTERNATIVE Hype**: $\text{Old Score} \lt \text{Final Score}$

**↑ LOOK AT THE TERMS THERE** ↑.
I know the 2nd one sounds flipped. It is. Let me explain.

- If you ***assume*** something to be true, then you check your assumption by making it a hypothesis (simple going).
- But, If you ***want*** something to be true, then you check its opposite by making the opposite as the hypothesis (just flip it).

Understood? Once more.

Main thing:
***Let's say the rain is raining*** (Hah, my grammar!).

Assumption:
> *This might be because of monsoon season*.

So, then I will set:
**NULL Hype**: $\text{Season} = \text{Monsoon}$
**ALTERNATIVE Hype**: $\text{Season} \neq \text{Monsoon}$

I want it to be true:
> *This is because of monsoon season*

So, then I will set:
**NULL Hype**: $\text{Season} \neq \text{Monsoon}$
**ALTERNATIVE Hype**: $\text{Season} = \text{Monsoon}$

Oh, why? Because we are gonna **test the hypothesis only**. If we follow such way as shown above we will get the answer.

More on this, in the following section. But till here - just try to keep in mind that:
1. We make **Null** and **Alternative** hypothesis.
2. The order of statement flips based on whether you're assuming or wanting.

### Little Rules
1. The null hypothesis **must** have an **EQUAL** sign. Which are $=, \le, \ge$ etc.
2. The alternative hypothesis **must not** have an **EQUAL** sign. Which are $\ne, \lt, \gt$ etc.

**Denotation**:

Null Hype → $H_0$
Alternative Hype → $H_1$

### Testing
Okay, we've set the hypothesis. Now, it is time to test them. 
- Assuming our null hypothesis is valid, if the probability of test is inside of the probability **curve of 0.05**, then we will **reject** the hypothesis.
- Here, 0.05 is the **Level Of Significance**.

The reason of doing the thing stated above is that, the hypothesis which we have assumed is rare. And the rare experiment's probability is of course small. Thus, we can safely reject it.

The 0.05 is the common probability denoting the level of significance. We might want to change it.

Mathematically, we denote it by $\alpha = 0.05$

> The level of significance $\alpha$ is the area inside the tail(s) of our null hypothesis.

*Tail(s) ← because tails can be 1 or 2.*

1. $\alpha = 0.05$, the *alternative hypothesis* is **less than** value, then the LEFT TAIL region is our POI. ![Less than](https://i.imgur.com/P7ketv9.png)
2. $\alpha = 0.05$, the *alternative hypothesis* is **more than** value, then the RIGHT TAIL region is our POI.

3. $\alpha = 0.05$, the *alternative hypothesis* is **not equal to** value, then the TOW TAILS of probability region share an are of 0.025.

### Test HowTo
As mentioned in the beginning of this file, we have the systematic way for calculating and decision making in statistics. Now we know the systematic way **to frame the hypothesis**. 

This is the time to discuss the systematic way to do the testing.
—
Recall from earlier discussion that the ***"we are working with the probability distribution where we try to find the area. To find the area we need the z-score."***

Let me show you the dots first, then we will connect them together in the summary section.

To get the z-score we have 2 methods.
### Two methods to get z-score
1. Test of MEAN
2. Test of PROPORTION

#### 1. Method of MEAN
It is used when in the hypothesis, we look to find the **average**, or **specific** value in the population. 

Get *z score* wile dealing with means:
## $$ z = \frac{\bar x - \mu}{\frac{\sigma} {\sqrt{n~}}} $$

Much, Much, Much like how we were used to calculate the z score *(if you recall $z = \frac{\bar x ~-~ \mu}{\sigma}$)*. ***Just*** the $\sqrt{n~}$ is added as the denominator of $\sigma$. 

**NOTE**: This ↑ method assumes that we know the population standard deviation ($\sigma$). If ***we don't know*** the std, then we need to perform the **T-Test** — about which we will learn later.

#### 2. Method of PROPORTION
It is when we say the ***relative terms*** *(not absolute / specific)* like: ***"40%"*** of ___ or ***"most of "*** the ___. It is when we are dealing with the proportions.

Get *z score* wile dealing with proportions:
## $$z = \frac{\hat p - p}{\frac{\sqrt{p ~\cdot~ q~}}{n}}$$
 
 Great!
 Now we have 1) **Hypothesis** and based on which we have performed the testing and got the 2) **Z score**.

This is the time when we need to decide whether or not **should we reject** or **fail to reject** *(not reject)* the hypothesis. This is the decision time buddy!

Now, how to decide? We actually know. We can look for the area under the curve. If that is less than 0.05 then reject otherwise keep.

But here, still we have got 2 methods to decide! *(Yes, 2 methods to decide)*.
1. **Traditional Method**:
	- Set the level of significance $\alpha$
	- Get the z score
	- Compare the test statistic to the z score 
2. **P-value Method:**
	- Get the z score
	- Use it to determine the P value
	- Compare the P value to the level of significance $\alpha$

# Great!
A lot of new things have been discussed here. Next up, we will walk through the actual example. See you there ∞
