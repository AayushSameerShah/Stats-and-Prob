# Standard Error
**Core Idea**: We are working on the sample. Alright. But the main aim is to *study* the population but because of the reasons like computational power, manpower, money etc. required to study whole population at once, we use sampling.

The sample must be representative of whole population, as we know it. Now, if we take some sample (irrespective of the method) we get some mean of sample which we denote by let's say $\bar x$. 

**Recall**, we have some terminology ahead which we have already learnt before — ***"Parameter"*** and ***"Statistic".*** We are gonna use them now here.

### Situation
<font size=6><b>L</b></font>et's say, we are studying for the population of 10,000 people. 

**For population**:

$N = \text{\# Members}$
$P = \text{Population Parameter}$
$\sigma = \text{Population Std.}$

—

**For Sample**:

$n = \text{\# Members}$
$p = \text{Sample Statistic}$
$SE_p = \text{Standard Error of Sample}~~~$ ←  ### POI ###

Of course there we can include the $\sigma_p$ for the sample, but the main area of our study is **not** that.

*Continuing to the example*:
$P = \bar X =~$The **average of population** = 10.4
$p = \bar x =~$The **average of sample** = 11.3

Now, seemingly the $\text{mean of population} \neq \text{mean of sample}$. So, that is some ***error***. 

>The Population Standard Dev ($\sigma$) describes <u>how far on an average the data points are from the mean.</u>
<br>—<br>
The Standard Error of Sample ($SE_p$)  describes <u>how far a sample mean is from the population mean.</u>

### Standard Error Calculation
### $$ SE_p = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

**Example**:
- Population:
	- $N = 100$ (100 people in population)
	- $\bar X = 54$
	- $\sigma = 12$
- Sample:
	- $n = 10$ (10 people in a sample)
	- $\bar x = 44$ 
	- $SE_p = ~?$

$SE_p = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{10}}$

$~~~~~~~~=3.7947$

Hence, the sample of 10 people, the means are expected to fall between 50.20 to 57.79.

**HOW TO PUT**:
> 68% of 10 item sample, means are expected to fall between  50.20 to 57.79 *(1 Standard Error of the sample statistic. )*
<br>
And We can say with 95% of **confidence level** that the population parameter $P$ lies within the confidence interval of 
$\pm$ 2 Standard Errors of the sample statistic. 

So now, $-2SE_p \text{~to~} 2SE_p = \text{Confidence Interval}$

In summary: The standard error is actually showing the relationship between the sample mean the the population mean. It can be useful to determine whether the sample taken from the population is reliable or not to some extent.

# Great!
Next up, we will look for the *COOL* term — Hypothesis testing. See you there ∞
