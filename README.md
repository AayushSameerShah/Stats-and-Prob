# Stats & Probability for Data Science

### Hello!
This time I am with another full-action packed content from the field of stats. This course delivers various concepts compiled in 
human language with stunning graphs and formulae. Feel free to start the tour now.

## But, Why?
The reason behind **why** I started this course and what it is, is that — I started learning stuff, EDA, ML, Charts, Graphs a lot of stuff
but there were many missing pieces in my understanding of the stats. I needed to fix them and also *(as always)* wanted to make a comprehensive
notebook which can be so much handy when I want to refer something back in the future. A digital notebook.

***But this time***, I took things differently. If you have seen my other projects / repositories, I was used to use jupyter notebooks,
no matter what the subject was *(even for git, I used jupyter notebook!)*. But this time, there was nothing to code, so I decided **no to**
use the jupyter notebooks and started using the markdown directly. It was my first try and the experience was amazing.

## I started, but - How and from Where?
This time, again my one of the favorite teacher *(can I say teacher?, danno!)* Jose Portilla - udemy. The course was amazingly crafted 
and was easy to follow. I made myself clear not to go much comprehensive as I used to and make the notes look like the notes only! So I 
haven't gone into much depth and pointed out main ideas from each concepts.

## What to Expect?
In this stats series, I have solved many - many example by hand and used latex to represent the steps. With the strusturized formulaes
the hands on procedure makes the files much neat and easy to follow (take the example solution for ANOVA [here](https://github.com/AayushSameerShah/Stats-and-Prob/blob/main/5.%20ANOVA/2.%20ANOVA%20Example.md)).

There are folders grouped by each concept name — which I guess are easily searchable.

## When GitHub Doesn't Help.
The worst side (again I want to emphasize) **the worst side** of github is that — it doesn't render the inline LaTex. Which results in
all formulae, steps, solutions, equations written in LaTex are fail. They will not be rendered on GitHub. They will be presented in the plain
freakin' text. 

It would be much more handy if github could render those, and you will be able to read them here, directly without leaving github, but nah! <br>
Have a look at this image:

And then, see how GitHub renders it:

It messed all up! <br>
**SOLUTION**: I would encourage you to add [Markdown Viwer Extention](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk) in yout chrome. Clone this repository and render it there. This is an amazing renderer and gives a lot of themes to choose from. It will give the right experience of reading my files.

## How to Start?
You should start it as as journey which builds up on the old knowledge, so start from the first file `My Stats.md`. Of course it contatins the welcoming words for me, and some personal notes which I like to give to myself, and then follow the increasing order of the folders. Then end your stats journey with `STAꓕƧ.md` file.

Huge Thanks for reading this far! Many exciting stuff is already in there. Check them out!
