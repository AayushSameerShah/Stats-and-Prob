# Tell Me Can You Believe This?
<font size=6><b>A</b></font>ayush, amazing!
You did it man! Now, finally I have met my monthly goal. In approx 12 days of stats, I have learnt, noted and got new things in my backpack. This is amazing thing!

It was a new experience to write in stackedit.io. It really helped me a lot. I don't know what to say but great things are now, bro noted and understood. You just have to come here again and refer when ever you need them to revise.

This time, I was also learning Tableau. It was the 9 hour course and just a bit is left in it. Today will complete it as well. Actually, I didn't note it as nothing to note about that here, so there will be no repository on my GitHub, but its fine. 

This is the start of my another new journey. It is **to prepare for the interviews**. It is my first time, first go, fresh go. Will start to prepare for it and revise all of those stuff that I got into my brain in this year of 2021

# Great!
See you somewhere at the better place **âˆž**
