# Bayes Theorem

I am making it out, of course but when you look at the formulae you will say the same. It is bayesically (we will use this instead of "basically") the conditional probability of **both events together**. I know that is the strong statement, but it is. Let's have a look at it bayesically that what it bayesically is!

If I have even `A` occurred before event `B` then...
$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$

The thing is we can too find the probability of `A` (yes I know which has been occurred before but still) if `B` has occurred (even if!)
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$

Let's say I want to find $P(A|B)$. The bayes theorem will help.

$P(A|B)$ has the $P(A \cap B)$ which we can get from the $P(B|A)$. Like...

$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$
`↓`
$P(B|A) \times P(A) = P(A \cap B)$
`↓`
$P(A \cap B) = P(B|A) \times P(A)$

`↓ (Finally we will put in the main equation)`

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$

**Hence, we have got the *Bayes Theorem***<br>*(writing in big fonts)*

# $$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} $$

Of course, this is an amazing thing out there to calculate and if you get the *feel* of what's happening in the equation then I am telling you, it is an amazing feeling!

The course shows an amazing and step-by-step process of solving the problem with the theorem, which I have never seen before. Let's do that ∞

**Problem Statement**
- A company produces the products from which `0.2%` are defective.
- So they buy the machine which can identify whether the product is defective or not
- The accuracy of the machine is `99%`

So, what is the probability ***If machine identified the product as defective, it really is defective?***

I know, a lot going on there, but let's say that our Bayes Theorem has all for us. 

<center> <b>Keep this in your mind</b> </center>

That, when the problem is to solve with the bayes theorem, there are high chances that you will have to find the "True Positives" and "False Positives". (Not True Negatives and False negatives) Only **TP** and **FP**.
<center> — </center>

So, here:
Event **A** = The product is defective
$\therefore P(A) = 0.002$
 *(given)*

Event **B** = The machine identifies defective
$\therefore P(B) = ?$
*(need to calculate)*

Event **A | B** = The product is defective given that the machine identifies it defective
$\therefore P(A|B) = ?$
*(since it is the main thing)*

Event **B | A** = The machine identifies it defective given that the product is defective
$\therefore P(B|A) = 0.99$ 
*(given)*

Now, we need to find:

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$
We have numerator already in the question, except just need to find the denominator. 

Now, $P(B)$ is the total probability that the machine finds the product as defective. Which means,

$$
\begin{align*}
\therefore P(B) & = \text{Probability of product being defective} \\
& = P(\text{TP}) + P(\text{FP}) \\\\
&\text{TP} = P(B|A) \times P(A)\\
&\text{FP} = P(B|A') \times P(A')\\\\
&P(B|A') = 1 - P(B | A)\\
&P(A') = 1 - P(A)
\end{align*}
$$
And that's how we will find all missing parts of the equation and will eventually get the result.

So here, let's interpret it as well.
**TP** = The machine found it defective and was defective
**FP** = The machine found it defective and was not defective

$\text{TP} = P(B|A) \times P(A) = 0.99 \times 0.002$
$\text{TP} = 0.00198$

$\text{FP} = P(B|A') \times P(A') = 1 - 0.99 \times 1 - 0.002$
$\text{FP} = P(B|A') \times P(A') = 0.01 \times 0.998$
$\text{FP} = 0.00998$

$\therefore P(B) = 0.00198 + 0.00998= 0.01196$

Putting the values back,
$P(A|B) = \frac{0.99 \times 0.002}{0.01196} = 0.165$

And, yeah we have got the result! Which means `16.5%` chances are there that the machine will find the item to be defective.

### There is one catch!

After finding the probability first time, if for the second time we want to find the probability then the last used probability will be used. Which is instead of `0.002` which was 1 product out of 500 being defective, we will use the `0.165` which is like 33 out of 200. 

I really don't know why but after that the probability will increase from `16.5%` to `95.1%`. 

# Great!
For the first time, we have handly solved the Bayes Theorem in such way.
