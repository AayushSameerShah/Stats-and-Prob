Yes. `Interunicomp`. It is not **i**nternational **u**niversity **c**ompetition but it is about the Inter... wai, let's discuss them right now.

> These help us understand "how the probabilities interact with each other"

Which later will help to understand the dependent events in conditional probability. 

### Intersections
*Describes the sample space when two events ***both*** occur*.
Denoted by: $A \cap B$

### Unions
*Describes the sample space when ***either of*** two events occur.*
Denoted by: $A \cup B$

The equation: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

### Complements
*Describes the elements ***outside*** of an event.*
Denoted by: $A'$

# Nextly,
We will build our understanding of *Dependent* and *Independent* events. I thought that requires its own file so, not covered here.
