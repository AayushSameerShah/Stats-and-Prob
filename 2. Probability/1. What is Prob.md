# Probability
*It is the value between 0 to 1 that a certain event will occur.* 

-  **Trials have no memory.** You flipped a coin, the probability of 0.5, then you kept flipping it, the probability was still 0.5. The trials are independent. Coin doesn't store that "if it got heads, then it has to get tail now".
- When the trials are "dependent", then they come under the "Conditional Probability" section.

# Permutation
*Is set of objects arranged in some sort of order.*
### $$ n! $$
↑ All latters All places

### $$ _nP_r = \frac {n!} {(n - r)!}$$
↑ It is when, you don't allow the repetition.

### $$ n^r $$
↑ It is when we do allow the repetition.

# Combinations
*It is where the order doesn't matter — **Unordered** arrangements of objects are called combinations.*

### $$ _nC_r = \frac {n!} {r! (n - r)!}$$

#### Permutation with repetition
### $$ _{n+r-1}C_r = \frac {(n + r - 1)!} {r! (n - 1)!} $$

# Next up,
We will shift gears. But I think will skip a lot. The next section will talk about the intersection and stuff. So it depends how I will be taking it. 
See you there.
