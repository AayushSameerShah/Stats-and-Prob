# Conditional Event
<b><font size=6>T</font></b>hese are the event in which the happening of another event ***affects*** its results / outcomes. But to understand them, we will need to talk about the **Independent** & **Dependent** events. And have to build a clear understanding of both.

## Independent Event
> The independent event is an event whose outcome has <u>no effect</u> on the outcome of other event.

## Dependent Event
> A dependent event is an event whose outcome <u>does</u> affect on the outcome of the another event. 

Common example: Drawing the marble from the box *without replacement*.

**Simple Calculation Structure:**
Say, there are 5 marbles. <font color="red">3 are red</font> and <font color="blue">2 are blue </font>. So in total it makes 5.
→ I am drawing 2 marbles 1 by 1 without replacement, then find the probability that both are <font color="red">red</font>.

* **Step 1**: It is the simple and the usual which we have been doing since then, **is to find the probability of first event**.
 
 See, here are 2 events, 1st is to find the prob of 1 red marble out of 5. The second event is to find the prob of another 1 red marble out of 4.
So, the step 1 is to find for the first prob.

Step 1 will always be the simple probability. The follow-up probability will have an effect and then will become the conditional / dependent. So the **step 1: Find the simple probability for the first event.**

$P(\text{first ball is red}) = \frac{3}{5}$

* **Step 2**: It is the step where we need to use some mind. It is not always easy going. You see, it can be, but have to take care to what are we dealing with.

Here, the first steps effect will be seen. We assume that we have drawn the red ball from those 5, so now we are left with <font color="red">2 red</font> balls and <font color="blue">2 blues</font>. 
Hence,

$P(\text{second ball is red | first ball is red}) = \frac{2}{4}$

See the change of notation?

So to summarize it, We can say that:
- Step 1: Find the simple probability
- Step 2: Find the conditional probability
- Step 3: Find the conditional probability if required (repeat till you want)

### The shorthand method from 12th classes
See, here we have divided out the problem in steps. by which we have got the $\frac{3}{5}$ and $\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ respectively. Now, for the final result we will be doing **the simple multiplication** to get the final result.

Which is:
$P(\text{First ball is red and Second ball is red}) = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{10}$
Okay? Is that correct?

But as I have learnt in the 12th, there is the shorthand method. It doesn't require use to divide in the steps, we can do it in one line. So, the same problem of picking 2 red balls out of 5 can be written in the following framework ↓

$$\text{Final Prob} = [\text{Event simple calculation}] \times [\text{Event with affected calculation}]$$

And there, we are done. Let's see in an example.

$$
\begin{align*}
P(\text{First and Second balls are red}) & =  [\text{Ball is red out of 5}] \times [\text{Ball is red out of 4}]\\
& = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} \\ \\
& = \frac{3}{10}
\end{align*}
$$

That is the same thing, but in short format and in single line.

### The multiplication of both probabilities
$$ 
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B | A)
$$

Great, now we are all set up so that we can start understanding of `Conditional Probability`.

# Conditional Probability
It is not new! ***What we have done in the `Step 2` is the conditional probability itself!***

> Normal Probability $= P(B) = \frac{m}{n}$
<br> Conditional Probability $= P(B | A) = \frac{m}{n}$

Yes! that's it.
So, when you read: *"Probability of B when the even A has occured"* interpret it as the conditional probability.

Now, from the previously learnt equation $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B | A)$ we can derive the following ↓

### $$P(B |A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)} {P(A)}$$
The same thing, but with a **question**. It sounds like the chicken and an egg question that *if you want to find A then you want to find B and if you want to find B then you want to find A.*

Now, how to solve this? Simply we can use (manually) the **intersection** for the numerator and get our work done.

**Amazing things going on, isn't it?** 
Now, I think it is the time to discuss the addition and multiplication rules.  Which is just the repetition of what we have just learnt.

# Addition & Multiplication `Rules`

## Addition
### ***Non-Mutually*** Exclusive Events
![Non-Exclusive](https://i.imgur.com/bStB7Od.png)
For such event we will have this for Addition:
### $$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$

### ***Mutually*** Exclusive Events
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/c4dzpJC.png)
For such event we will have this for Addition:
### $$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $$

## Multiplication
## ***Independent*** Events
### $$ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) $$

## ***Dependent*** Events
### $$ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B | A) $$

I don't think (know) whether the events being mutually exclusive / inclusive will affect here, because see if they are inclusive - the intersection will give some  value, otherwise the intersection ie $P(A \cap B)$  will return 0.

# Great!
Next up, we will look a the Bayes Theorem.
