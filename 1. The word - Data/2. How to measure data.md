# The types of measures
Here, we will see various symbols (term *various*, don't think too much okay!) and the types of measurements which will help use to build our understanding in the later sections. Firstly he introduces the types of measures like nominal and ordinal... let's get through them a little quick.

1. **Nominal**:
	- Predetermined categories
	- Can't be sorted
2. **Ordinal**:
	- Can be sorted
	- Lacks numerical scale (Like if you are happy, how much? can't be answered)
3. **Interval**:
	- Provides the scale
	- Lacks some trues "zero" point.
4. **Ratio**:
	- Have a true "zero" point

**Population** & **Sample**, easy going â€” right?

### Simple freaking symbols
- $\bar x =$ X squared
- $x_i =$ th element
- $x! =$ X factorial
- $x^2 =$ The square of X
- $\mu =$ The mean
- $\sum =$ The sum
- $x^{-3} = \frac {1}{x \times x \times x}$

# Okay,
Done for now, not getting to learn something new. But next up we will learn about the central tendency. Which indeed not a new to learn but still always good to have within the mind. And I will try to cover all ***tendencies*** at once in the single book.
See you there.
