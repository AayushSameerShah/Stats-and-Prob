> Data is the collection of observations that we have about something.

-   Categorical
    -   Ordinal
    -   Nominal
-   Numerical
    -   Discrete
    -   Continuous
        
### Why data **matters**?
1.  **Helps us understand the things as they are.**
    -  What relationship between event A and B is if exists?
      *Here, we will need the data to understand the relationship.*
    - Do people need to see the doctors less if they eat more apple than those who eat less?
      *Again, we will need data to answer these kind of questions.*
 2. **Predict future behaviour**
	 - Based on the user's click history, which ad is more likely to be shown on our website?

<font size=6><b>T</b></font>hen we can visualize the data. And also *mislead* people by showing the **misleading visual**.

# That's it!
Hah, again I know I am following the same trend of stating **That's it** in the big-bold letters and conclude the book here, but it sounds find and friendly. I might use new one after wards when I find new way to conclude it. 

Yes, you are right, it is not whole a lot, but as I have said, less is more and time matters. So only important things will be noted here bro, I know you can âˆž
